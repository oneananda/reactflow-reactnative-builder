# ReactFlow ReactNative Builder

**ReactFlow ReactNative Builder** is a drag-and-drop tool for building React Native pages using ReactFlow. This project allows users to visually create UI components and generate React Native code in real-time, making mobile app development faster and more intuitive.

---

## Features

- 🖱️ **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Create UI layouts by dragging and dropping components.
- ⚡ **React Native Code Generation**: Instantly generate React Native code for your designs.
- 🌟 **Customizable Components**: Extendable to add your own components.
- 💾 **Export Code**: Save generated code as a `.js` file for integration into your projects.
- 📦 **Mobile-Ready**: Use the generated code with Expo or React Native CLI for rapid development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oneananda/reactflow-reactnative-builder.git
   cd reactflow-reactnative-builder
   ```

## Usage

1. **Drag Components**: Use the sidebar to drag components like `Text`, `Button`, and `View` onto the canvas.
2. **Customize Properties**: Click on a component to modify its properties, such as text, color, or dimensions.
3. **Generate Code**: Click the **Generate Code** button to see the corresponding React Native code.
4. **Export Code**: Save the generated code as a `.js` file for further development.

## Example

Here’s a sample of the generated code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const GeneratedPage = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Welcome to ReactFlow!</Text>
      <Button title="Click Me" onPress={() => alert('Button Pressed')} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default GeneratedPage;
```
